Everyday life in the JVA Hanover
Daily routine of a prisoner in the prison in Hanover -
from the point of view of a prisoner

Wake
up My day certainly starts unusually early for some inmates, because I get up at 4.45 a.m., first reach for the cigarette, then the first coffee is made and a few more cups of coffee will follow before the prison is unlocked at 6 a.m. In addition to breakfast television, there is also everyday dental care.

Start of work
Since I'm lucky enough to be able to do retraining as a cook in the local teaching kitchen, my working day doesn't start until around 6.45 a.m., everyone else goes to their workplaces at 6.30 a.m. The work is fun, but also requires a certain level of resilience, teamwork, creativity and willingness to work. Hygiene is the be-all and end-all.

My lunch break is at 1:00 p.m., I can't complain about the food, because I eat what our servants eat myself (and just between us, it tastes good every day). 

Closing
time Closing time for us is at 2 p.m., the rest of the companies return to their houses around 2.30/45 p.m. Now do the "homework" and then there is still time to take a shower and a cup of coffee. At 3:00 p.m. we have our free period, soak up some sun (if it's there) and make small talk with others. At 4:00 p.m. itâ€™s time to move in. For me, that means getting supper now, picking up my post and newspaper, two days a week I still have school until 6.15 p.m., after that I can still call my family or friends before night lock-up is at 7.50 p.m .

Before I go to bed I'll eat my supper, maybe write a few reports, get ready for work the next day, answer letters and listen to some music or watch TV.

Sometimes it's like in the movie: "Groundhog Day."

But that's everyday life...
