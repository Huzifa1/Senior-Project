training and retraining
Many inmates have neither school nor a professional qualification. However, a good education is a good prerequisite for gaining a foothold in society after release and for shaping life in a meaningful way.
The JVA Hannover, in cooperation with other educational institutions, therefore offers inmates who want to change their lives and actively participate a variety of educational opportunities.

There are long-term retraining measures that last up to two years. The training then ends with a journeyman's certificate as

- cook
- carpenter
- metal worker
- orthopedic shoemaker
- glass and building cleaner or
- garden and landscape designer.

Inmates who are serving short sentences can take part in the qualification measures

- glass and building cleaning assistants
- garden and landscaping assistants
- metalworkers
- carpenters
- gastronomy

take part. These measures are usually designed to last a few months, but provide a broad basic knowledge.


The main and real qualifications can also be made up for in school courses. In a basic course, basic qualifications in spelling, mathematics and general knowledge are taught in order to prepare for acceptance into a follow-up measure within or outside of prison.
