Telephone calls to inmates
Calls directly to detainees are not possible. They can be called by an inmate. To do this, you must first register.



Please download the form provided for download, fill it out and send it to the JVA Hannover or hand it in at the gate on your next visit.
You can also take the form with you when you visit the visiting room.
